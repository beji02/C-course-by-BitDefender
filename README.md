# C-course-by-BitDefender

**Part I: C programming basics and data structures**
- learned more about strings, files, pointers, struct and preprocessing in C
- learned about data structures such as static array, vector, stack, queue, linked-list, binary-search-tree, hash-table, heap

**First project**'s task was implementing and testing of some data structures in C (hash-table, heap, linked-list, stack, tree, vector)




**Part II: WIN32 API and multithreading programming**
- learned about unicode and secure string functions
- kernel objects
- processes, threads, synchronization, concurrency

**Second project**'s task was to create a client-server system that will function as a messaging application (using WIN32 API).
For this purpose I've developed two console-applications **MessageClient.exe** and **MessageServer.exe** that use **MessageCommunicationLib.lib** library provided by the BitDefender team in order to achieve the scope of the project.
